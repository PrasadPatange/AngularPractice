1) Create Custom Directve =>
   cmd =>  ng g directive <directive_name>

2) Create Lazy Loading Module =>
    cmd => ng g m <Module_Name> --route <Module_Route> --module app.module

Automatically create Path in routing file.

3) All Angular Generate Commands =>
     https://angular.io/cli/generate

4) Create Interceptor =>
     cmd => ng generate interceptor <interceptor_name>

5) ViewChild and ViewChildren :
    => Use for DOM Manipulation.
    => If you want to get refference from your element in template file (HTML) into the component Class (TS)
       so in this case ViewChild and ViewChildren can be used.


like JS : <div id="text">This is JS </div>   // html
          const text = doument.getElementById('text');  // js 

In Angular : <div #text>This is Angular </div>    // html
             @ViewChild('text') txt : ElementRef;    //ts

             ngAfterViewInit(){
               console.log(this.txt);
             }

@ViewChild() => only Points to first matching element.
@ViewChildren() => points to the multiple elements.

 => Also Use for component Communication :
   => If you want to access any Information from the child component into the parent component there Also
      we used ViewChild and ViewChildren.



6) Content Projection with ng-content :
 => If You want to pass html to child component from parent component.
 => where you can pass html from parent to child component and you can decide to make your component more reusable.

 => To project some unique html from the template of the parent component, you need to add content between the 
    opening and closing tags of the nested child component.
 
     parent.html :

    <child>
    <h2>Top Product</h2>
    </child>

 => And in order to actually display the content inside of the nested component add the ng-content tag to 
    a certain place in the template where you want to render the projected code .

    child.html :

    <div>
    <ng-content></ng-content>
    <p> Some Random Data</p>
    </div>


7) Promise vs Observable : 
  => Both are used to handle async operations in angular.

  Promise                                                      Observable
1) Promise always asynchronous.                            1) Observable can be either async or synchronous.

2) Not Lazy(Eager) : Promises execute                      2) Observables are Lazy.
   immediately after creation.                                don't execute until we don't subscribe it
                                                              using subscribe() method.

3) Promises emit Single Value.                             3) Emits multiple value over a period of time.

4) Promise don't Provide operators.                        4) Observables provides rxjs operators like map,filter,
                                                              reduce, retry,etc.that is useful for complex transfromation.
                                                            
5) Promise are not cancellable.                            5) Observables can be cancel using unsubscribe() method.

6) const obj = new Promise(d => {});                       6) const obj = new Observable(sub => {}); 
   obj.then(res => {});                                       obj.subscribe(res => {});



8) Rxjs Subject :
 => A subject is an Observable that can multicast. i.e. talk to many observers.
 => Subject in Angular use to Communicate with one or more components.

9) Types of subjects :
  1) BehaviorSubject :
    => A BehaviorSubject holds one value(Initial or last emitted value).
    => When it is subscribed it emits the value immediately.

  2) ReplaySubject :
    => It Emits or buffer old values and emit those values to new subscribers.


  3) AsyncSubject :
    => Async Subject only emits a value when it completes.
    => it will emit its latest/last value to all its observers on completion.


9) Observable vs Subject :
 
 Observable                                        Subject

 1) Observable are unicasts.                      1) Subject are Multicast.

 2) Unicasting means that each subscribed         2) Multicasting basically means that one Observable execution
   observer own an independent execution of          is shared among multiple subscribers. 
   the Observable.                                   Subjects are like EventEmiiters, they maintain registry of many
                                                     listeners.
                                                

10) Http Interceptors :
  => Interceptors are a unique type of angular service that we can implement to intercept 
     Incoming or Outgoing HTTP request / response using HttpClient.
   
  => operations using Interceptors :
     1) Modify Http Headers.
     2) Modifying the request body.
     3) Set Authenticaion / Authorization Token.
     4) Mock the backend Api.
     5) Modify the response.
     6) Error Handling.
   
11) Angular Forms  :
   1) Template Driven Forms => TDF
   2) Reactive Forms   => Model Driven Form
 
 =>  Diffference :

   Template Driven Form                                          Reactive Form
1) Created by directives                              1) Created in Component Class.
2) low Scalibility                                    2) High Scalibility 
3) asynchronous data flow                             3) synchronous data flow.
4) FormsModule                                        4) ReactiveFormsModule
5) 2-way data binding                                 5) no 2-way data binding
6) mutable data flow                                  6) Immutable data flow
7) Unit testing is a challenge                        7) Testable

=> Common Foundation :
  1) FormControl: 
    => this is a class that enable validations
    => Each instance of this class help to check the values of the field whether it is touched , untouched 
       dirty , pristine ,etc.

  2) FormGroup:
     => This class represents a group of controls.
     => FormGroup can have multiple FormControls.
     => FormGroup returns true if all controls are validate.

  3) FormArray:
     => Similar to FormGroup class FormArray represents a group of controls.
     => FormArray is used to create dynamic controls.

  4) ControlValueAccessor:
     => creates a bridge between Angular FormControl instances and native DOM elements.
   

=> Choose Reactive Forms When :
  1) Handling Complex Forms.
  2) Following Reactive Approach.
  3) Dynamic controls.
  4) Lots of validations / custom validations.

=> Choose TDF When :
  1) Handling simple/basic forms.
  2) less validations rules.


12) Diffference between ViewChild and ContentChild :
   
   1) @ViewChild() :
     => If we want to access DOM elements (html) into its component class (ts) use ViewChild and ViewChildren.

   2) @ContentChild() :
     => Any element or component projected inside this component with the help of content projection 
        so we want to access those elements or compoent then we have to use ContentChild and ContentChildren.

   Ex: 
     <h2 #header>This is ViewChild</h2>          // use ViewChild
     <ng-content></ng-content>                  // use ContentChild
